## How to Use These Guidelines

These documents represent our team's current best practices, not rigid rules. They should be treated as living documents that evolve with our team's experience and needs.

1. **Read First**: Start with guidelines relevant to your current task
2. **Apply When Appropriate**: Use the recommended approaches when they fit your situation
3. **Suggest Improvements**: If you find better approaches, propose updates to these guidelines
4. **Ask Questions**: Use these documents as conversation starters

## Contributing to Guidelines

We welcome improvements to these guidelines! To contribute:

1. Create a branch from `main`
2. Make your changes or additions
3. Submit a PR with a clear explanation of your proposed changes
4. Seek feedback from the team

Remember that good guidelines are clear, practical, and reflect actual team practices rather than theoretical ideals.
